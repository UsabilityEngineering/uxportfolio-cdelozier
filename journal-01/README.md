# Setting Up Yubico Authentication Key - Yubikey
by Cody DeLozier on Feburaury 22nd, 2020

My initial goal before reading anything on the Yubikey was to set it up to protect my Google account specifically. For those unaware, multifactor authentication (MFA) is a secure way to protect your online accounts such as Dropbox, personal bank login etc. This type of MFA requires that the user enter their password followed by tapping the physical key against their phone (for mobile users) or tapping the physical key with their finger for desktop/laptop users to login.

A narrative that describes your user experience with technology. It should include your goals, a description of the interaction, and the outcome. You should assess the user experience in terms of concepts taught in class and/or high-level usability goals: effective, efficient, safe, satisfying, learnable, memorable, useful, error tolerant. When any of the terms are used in your narrative, you should highlight them in bold and provide a description in your own words. Each journal entry should have at least one unique term that is described (not already in a previous journal entry). The assessment of the interaction can be nuanced, acknowledging any strengths and weaknesses. Suggestions for how the weaknesses can be addressed will make for a strong journal entry.
