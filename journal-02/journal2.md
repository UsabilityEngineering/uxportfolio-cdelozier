# Using the 4-Slice Toaster Oven by General Electric 
by Cody DeLozier on April 12th, 2020

   Unfortunately my old roommate moved out and took their toaster with them leaving me toaster-less so to speak. Earlier this month my parents decided to give me their old toaster oven made by General Electric. **Spoiler alert**: I have never used a toaster oven before. so this was a relatively new experience for me. The first thing I put in the toaster oven was a piece of regular white bread. Without reading instructions or asking my parents for advice I decided to try and figure out the appliance by myself.

   I started by lifting the glass using the black handle as shown in the picture below. **My first thought**: why is this handle on the side of the glass vertically and not at the bottom of the glass horizontally for better leverage? Ignoring my retorical question, I continued to lift the glass upwards until I had reached it's max open height. I proceeded to remove the aluminum tray and place my bread directly on the metal rack itself. I closed the glass after placing my bread in the center of the rack.

   After taking a quick inspection of the oven knobs and light indicator, everything seemed fairly straight forward. I started by turning the lower knob to the icon with the picture of a half toasted piece of bread as this is my usual preference. Fortunately for me, the upper knob was already on the "toast" option, making the toaster oven start immediately. Within seconds I watched the coils get red hot and begin toasting my bread with the useful feedback of a ticking sound indicating that the oven is currently running and running on a timer. I patiently waited for the job to complete and once completed, I received feedback in the form of a bell indicating that my toast is now done. After pulling out my toast I was happy to discover it was toasted as expected.

   I also tested out using the oven feature with french fries using-the upper knob to turn the oven on to 350 degrees fahrenheit as described on the instructions on my bag of frozen fries. I simply turned the lower knob to the "Oven ON" option which I found quite straight forward, causing the oven to start heating up to the selected temperature. After setting a timer for the specified time on my phone, I patiently waited. Once the timer had gone off, I pulled out the fries to notice they were baked to perfection.

   All in all, the user experience for this GE Toaster Oven was **learnable** and **effective** at getting the job done. This experience was learnable in that through a little bit of testing and hands on use, it could easily be mastered within the first 1-3 times of being used. I also found this experience effective in that the controls correctly represent what the user would expect them to do. This is extremely important for an appliance such as a toaster oven where the user would like to set their preference on how much their bread gets toasted. With controls that are straight forward, the user can effectively get the job done as expected. I was able to accomplish my goal in less than about 8 minutes for my first use on this toaster oven. This experience was also **satisfying** with the useful feed back such as the physical ticking timer and the physical bell to indicate when your food is ready. The only weakness worth noting would be that the handle to open the sliding glass door could be designed a bit better for ease of use. Designing a handle with more leverage would make it easier to open and close the oven in between jobs making the overall experience slighltly more efficient.
