# Using the 4-Slice Toaster Oven by General Electric 
by Cody DeLozier on April 12th, 2020

   Unfortunately my old roommate moved out and took their toaster with them leaving me toaster-less so to speak. Earlier this month my parents decided to give me their old toaster oven made by General Electric. **Spoiler alert**: I have never used a toaster oven before. so this was a relatively new experience for me. The first thing I put in the toaster oven was a piece of regular white bread. Without reading instructions or asking my parents for advice I decided to try and figure out the appliance by myself.

   I started by lifting the glass using the black handle as shown in the picture below. **My first thought**: why is this handle on the side of the glass vertically and not at the bottom of the glass horizontally for better leverage? Ignoring my retorical question, I continued to lift the glass until I had reached it's max open height. I proceeded to remove the aluminum tray and place my bread directly on the metal rack itself. I closed the glass after placing my bread in the center of the rack.

   After taking a quick inspection of the oven knobs and light indicator, everything seemed fairly straight forward. I started by turning the lower knob to the icon with the picture of a half toasted piece of bread as this is my usual preference. Fortunately for me, the upper knob was already on the "toast" option, making the toaster oven start immediately. Within seconds I watched the coils get red hot and begin toasting my bread with the useful feedback of a ticking sound indicating that the oven is currently running and running on a timer. I patiently waited for the job to complete and once completed I received feedback in the form of a bell indicating that my toast is now done. After pulling out my toast I was happy to discover it was toasted as expected.

I also tested out using the oven feature of this toaster with french fries using-the upper knob to turn the oven on to 350* fahrenheit as described on the instructions on my bag of frozen fries. I simply turned the lower knob to the "Oven ON" option which I found quite straight forward causing the oven to start heating up to the selected temperature.
