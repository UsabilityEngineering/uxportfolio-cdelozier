# Using the Logitech Harmony Elite Remote
by Cody DeLozier on May 9th, 2020

   This weekend I was able to test out my parents’ new smart tv and sound system. I was surprised to discover they had decided to go with a universal smart remote, rather than using the remote provided with the TV. At a first glance, there is a lot going on with this remote not typical in a standard smart TV remote. Starting from the top left-hand corner of the remote there is the standard “off” button as expected that powers off the entire system. Just below the off button there is a small touch screen that provides the user with several options. I discovered if you pick up the remote, the screen will turn on automatically for you displaying the following options: Watch TV, Netflix, Watch a Movie and Sonos (music software). You can select any of these options and they will open the specified command on the TV. I used Netflix as my choice and discovered the TV turned on and launched Netflix as I had hoped.
